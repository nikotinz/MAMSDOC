The interesting effect size is set to \\(p = 0.65\\), which corresponds to an effect of \\(ﾎｴ = 0.545ﾏソ\) on the traditional scale. The uninteresting treatment effect is chosen as \\(p_0 = 0.55\\) (\\(ﾎｴ_0 = 0.178ﾏソ\)). MAMS allows the user to choose whichever parameterization they prefer for specifying the effect sizes."

    "text": "A single-stage design\nDesigning studies including finding the boundaries of the design and the required sample size can be achieved with the function mams. The parameters of the function correspond to the definition in Section 2 (Jaki, Pallmann, and Magirr 2019) so that K, e.g., specifies the number of experimental treatments that are to be compared to control, and J the number of stages. We begin by considering a single-stage design (J = 1), which corresponds to a design based on a standard Dunnett test (Dunnett 1955) involving K = 3 experimental treatments. We use equal allocation between treatment arms, which is specified via r=1 for the experimental arms and r0=1 for control.\n\n  沺｡ Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nAn overview of the design is displayed with print(m1) or summary(m1) or simply m1.\n\n  沺｡ Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nThe output produced specifies the number of patients required on control and each treatment arm as well as the boundaries of the design. A total of 316 patients, 79 on control and 79 on each of the 3 experimental treatments, are required for this study. The null hypothesis for treatment k can be rejected if the corresponding test statistic is larger than 2.062. The same design can also be specified on the scale of traditional effect sizes rather than probabilities, by setting \\(p\\) and \\(p0\\) to \\(NULL\\) and specifying values for \\(delta\\), \\(delta0\\), and \\(sd\\). The output will be exactly the same as for m1.\n\n  沺｡ Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  沺｡ Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nIn the remainder of this section we will specify all effect sizes on the probability scale, but converting them is straightforward in R:\n\n  沺｡ Loading\n    webR...\n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  沺｡ Loading\n    webR..."
